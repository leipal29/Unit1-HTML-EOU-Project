        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>I'm a freshman at Bergen Tech, Teterboro, that is enrolled in the Computer Science
            program. I chose this program because I always enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing 
            my code turn into a website that people can use. I started coding when I was in 3rd grade.
