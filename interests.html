        <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p> Even though I am passionate about coding and computer science, I have many other
            hobbies and interests outside of school. Here are some of them!
        </p>

            <h3>Reading Books</h3>
            <img src="books.webp" alt="Picture of many books" width="400" >
            <p>I'm a big reader, and have read so many books. I mostly read different types of
                fiction as I don't like non-fiction too much. You will always see me reading a different
                book every week because I finish books that fast. Whenever I have free time, the only
                thing I do is read.  
            </p>
            <p><strong>Top 3 Favorite Books of All Time:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Divergent</li>
                <li>Harry Potter</li>
                <li>Twilight</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why I Love Reading:</strong></p>
            <p>I love reading because everything can be perfect than your life which makes you
                imagine that life. You can imagine anything you want based on the words, and it takes
                you to a different universe. Additonally some books you can just relate too.

            <h3>Swimming</h3>
            <img src="swimming.webp" alt="Picture of someone swimming" width="400" >
            <p>I love swimming so much. I have been swimming for 2 years and I am almost a master. I
                know all four strokes, freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. I have not joined
                a swim team yet, but I look forward to it. 
            </p>
        
            <p><strong>Why I Love Swimming:</strong></p>
            <p>I love swimming because it helps me clear my mind of all the things that happened 
                throughout the week. I love the feeling of going in the water and pushing it when you 
                do your stroke. Additonally, it helps with endurance and it gives a workout for your 
                whole body.Its overall very relaxing for me.
